# witch-fantasy
I've abandoned this project for quite a while. The only reason why this repo still exists is to showcase the kind of stuff that I do in Unity as a hobby, and maybe to give out free code and particle effects to any user that bumps into this repo. 

Built with Unity 2020.1.0a14.1541. WebGL is currently really fucky, but if I do manage to get it running, you can see it here at https://danielnyan.github.io/witch-fantasy/index.html. The source code can be found in the demo-source branch.

If that doesn't work, just clone the repo on your computer, download Unity and open the project. 

You are free to use any assets here except for the Wizard Boy and Witch Girl models (all rights reserved), as well as any public Unity Assets / fonts that are obviously not created by me, namely,
