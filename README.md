# witch-fantasy-webgl
The source files for the WebGL build meant to showcase the basic concepts 
of the game. This game is unfinished and it will probably remain so.
Also note that the colour space is converted to gamma space while the 
game originally uses linear colour space, so colours shown will differ 
from the final product.

Please refer to https://github.com/danielnyan/witch-fantasy for the 
actual project.
